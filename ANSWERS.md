1. How long time did you end up spending on this coding test?
* Around 6 hours
2. Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.
* Using correct abstractions is always challenging and fun, I wanted to 
represent the entities used as objects, i.e the Room, the Car, the Movements etc.
Pattern wise I saw a use for both Observer (rendering movement updates) and Command for encapsulating the logic and
having the ability to store them for later on if wanting to undo/replay

3. What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time on the coding test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.
* Multiple cars driving turn based
* Undo and replay functionality
* More tests
4. What did you think of this recruitment test?
* Good, not too hard and not too easy. Covers a lot of ground of stuff used.
